# Kids Mini Rugby

Kids Mini Rugby is a site targeted for parents to find out about Mini Tag Rugby for juniors at their local rugby club in Guildford.  The site hopes to help users navigate what is on offer for children from the ages of 5 to 10 years old.  It will give information to parents seeking to sign up their child / children for mini tag rugby at the weekends at their local community rugby club. It will provide descriptions of the Club Officials who are volunteers and list the times and days available for coaching sessions that are run.

It hopes to provide a friendly representation of the club by including images and videos of play and directions for where the games are played.
